# Crimes_in_Boston
This EDA looks at crime incident reports in the city of Boston from June 2015 to September 2018. I use Folium for plotting an interactive heatmap of Boston, and seaborn for everything else.

# In order to see the map, download it and open it up in your web browser and then you can easily see the folium heatmap.
